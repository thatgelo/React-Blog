                    Mukbangs first originated in South Korea around 2010, combining the Korean words for "eat" and "broadcasting." Mukbangs can have a large variety in their content,
                    ranging from silent / no-talking mukbang ASMR's to full on podcast-like mukbangs full of true crime stories.
