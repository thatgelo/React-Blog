                    Mukbangs first originated in South Korea around 2010, combining the Korean words for "eat" and "broadcasting." Mukbangs can have a large variety in their content,
                    ranging from silent / no-talking mukbang ASMR's to full on podcast-like mukbangs full of true crime stories.

                    I like watching mukbangs mostly while I eat, rather than when I'm bored. If I were to watch mukbangs while in bed or while bored, I would 
                    get hungry, which is not a good sign for me at 2:43 am in the morning. I would rather watch mukbangs while eating, and to be honest I'm not sure why.
                    However, after researching the Internet, it states that it could help satsify the experience of eating while satisfying their own desire to eat. I guess 
                    for me it feels like I get to eat as much as I can without binge eating, which is something that could be bad for my health.

                    There's a lot more psychology that goes into it, but I'm sadly not a psychologist. However, I would definitely love to learn more!
